- [Dr. Scott Eilers](https://www.youtube.com/@DrScottEilers) ‚Äî ‚ÄúMy goal for this channel is to put the highest quality information about **depression** and **anxiety** in the hands of the people who need it most; those who are living with it every day.‚Äù _(Dr. Eilers has long-term, personal experience with anxiety and depression, he seems to have a good idea of what he is talking about, and the advice seems rooted in the experience of clinical practice.)_
- [Therapy in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/@TherapyinaNutshell) ‚Äî ‚Äú‚Ä¶ my mission is to make mental health resources easier to access. I take therapy skills and psychological research and condense them down into bite-sized nuggets of help.‚Äù _(Has some excellent videos on managing anxiety, panic attacks, vagus nerve exercises, etc)_
